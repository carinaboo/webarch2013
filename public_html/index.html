					About Me
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a 3rd year undergrad majoring in Computer Science.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a design and tech fanatic. I enjoy designing useful, delightful web applications. Soon I'll be building them too! I also really like teaching--used to tutor writing at the SLC, taught a Bicycle Repair DeCal, and did web design workshops.
				</p>
				<p>
					I work part-time as a web designer at <a href="https://www.rescomp.berkeley.edu/">ResComp</a> here on campus and as a User Experience Designer at <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a>, a startup in San Mateo.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm an avid cyclist, really enjoy doing outdoorsy things (hiking, kayaking, scuba diving!), and love traveling.
