11
SELECT * from links WHERE created > "2013-10-14";


How many links that were added before 2013-10-14 have fewer than 40 hits?

3
SELECT * from links WHERE created < "2013-10-14" AND hit_count < 40;





INSERT

Insert your own URL with a date before 2013-10-14 with greater than 40 hits.

INSERT into links VALUES ("http://carinaboo.com/ ", "cgboo", 99, "2013-09-30");
   

Is it possible that someone querying the database at the same time could see your insert partially complete (eg. only see some fields filled in)? What database property is this related to?

Not possible because of "Atomicity: all updates happen or none do" which means either all columns are updates and show up or none do.





UPDATE

Increment the hit_count for only your new row. What is the new count?

100
UPDATE links SET hit_count = "100" WHERE long_url = "http://carinaboo.com/";
UPDATE links SET hit_count = "100" WHERE short_url = "cgboo";
